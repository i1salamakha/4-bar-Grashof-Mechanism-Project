# 4-bar-Grashof-Mechanism-Project

#This was a final project for Kinematics and done with a group
#The project was to create a mechanism with anything from 4 to 6 bars, the purpose is a new idea for an existing issue that can be solved with this mechanism in this time.
#It is meant to have a typed report (about 5-15 pages), SolidWorks DWG file(s), Matlab code file(s) to show the mathematics behind it all with plotted graphs, and a PowerPoint Presentation.


###DESCRIPTION###
#The idea that we had come up with was a simple 4-bar rock crusher. This rock crusher, despite the name we gave it, is not meant only to crush rocks but can also flatten cans or plastic cups and because of a certain error that we noticed, can 'grip' an item. We thought this can be used with the purpose of construction use, recycling, some type of material repurposing, etc. With this in mind we thought a 4-bar mechanism should serve our purpose enough in this project.

#The plate that is meant to crush the rocks is on the longer link while the link that will provide the most force in the mechanism is the shortest link. The link rotates a full circle and that joint is grounded to the board. The base is in the shape of an L with the longest side on the ground and the shortest side is where the plate crushes the rocks against it.
